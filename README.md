# Assignment-BirdWatcher
Track species of birds observed, and related statistics

Exercise 103 from Object-Oriented programming with Java, part I provided by the University of Helsinki.

Only Main.java, Bird.java and BirdDatabase.java in src folder have been created as part of this exercise.

The test protocol and other files and folders were provided as part of the exercise.

Possible improvements:

- Help command to list allowed commands

- Add class with method to handle string matching, case insensitive, trim white space

- Handle attempted addition of duplicate entries

- Allow partial searches in show method, returning all matching Bird objects. (E.G. user input of "gull" could print Common gull and Black-tailed gull)
